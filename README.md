Greetings,

Prashant Kumar this side...
and here i'll tell you how to set up and run the application i have made.


so basically there are two php files and one sql database.

so what you have to do is--->
step.1 - Just import the database into Mysql Database.

Step.2 - open assignment folder and run Form.Php file on the browser.

And That's it.....


note- if you find any error in the code then please let me know.
